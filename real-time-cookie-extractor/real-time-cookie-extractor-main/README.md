## 💡 Why Use This?

Web scraping tools like `requests` or `httpx` often break when session cookies expire. This tool launches a real browser (Chrome), visits the target site, waits for cookies to be generated by JavaScript, and extracts them automatically.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time cookie extraction from any website
- ✅ Works in both **headless** and **GUI** mode
- ✅ Supports easy integration with `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, etc.
- ✅ Lightweight and minimal — just plug and play
